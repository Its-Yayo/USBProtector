# USBProtector
A single tool to protect USB ports from USB killers and stuff. Script made specifically for Linux

## Usages
This tool will automatically install the packages you need to enable/disable power supply and/or kernel modules through USB ports since a USB killer and more stuff usually works this way. 

Just clone this repository and execute it

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Its-Yayo/USBProtector.git
$ cd USBProtector/src
$ chmod a+x tool.sh ; sudo bash tool.sh
```

## Important Note
Use this just in case if you think you feel you need to protect you USB ports. By disabling power supply from your USB ports, you won't be able to use any power output devices such as keyboards, mouses, etc. so be careful. This tool allows you to revert changes if needed. 

NOTE: Note that this script will not be compatible with every single computer so you might check your system specs. 

## License
No license. I just made this not also to learn bash but to build a different quamtum energy of what i've been writing in my articles and in my mental notes about protecting special things in a different and complex way. ❤️
